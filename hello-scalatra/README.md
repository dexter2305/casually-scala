# hello-scalatra

Applying cake pattern to the complete concept of using scalatra has been very tricky. It is much easier to implement without a cake pattern.

- apply cake pattern to ScalatraServlets. That's it.  
- Keep org.scalatra.Lifecyle outside the cake. (v2 impl is difficult to maintain)
- Keep servlet container also outside the cake.
